# Using Footprinting Tools

## How can the information from domain records be used?

### Hackers
- **Spearphishing:** Visible personal names and emails in domain records can be used to send fake emails and steal information.
- **Reconnaissance:** Exposed IPs and name servers help attackers map networks and identify vulnerabilities.
- **DDoS Attacks:** If IPs are available, attackers can target servers with DDoS attacks to disrupt services.

### Ethical Hackers
- **Vulnerability Testing:** Use IPs and name servers to locate and fix security flaws before exploitation.
- **Network Monitoring:** Track IP traffic to detect suspicious activity and respond to potential threats.
- **Incident Response:** Access to network details allows quick mitigation during cyberattacks.

## Domain Exposure Analysis

- **tccd.edu:** Most exposed, with detailed employee and network information, making it highly vulnerable to spearphishing and network attacks.
- **gob.mx:** Shares network data but no personal details, reducing phishing risk but remaining vulnerable to network-based attacks.
- **tarrantcountytx.gov:** Similar to gob.mx, sharing technical data while protecting personal details.
- **fbi.gov:** Most secure, offering minimal exploitable information, protecting against most common attacks.
